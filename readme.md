# JumpSuit
A sweet canvas game.
With your awesome suit, you can jump from planet to planet to the exit!

Try it [here](https://getkey.eu/jumpsuit)!

## Why the name?
```
Getkey: What about "jumpsuit"
Flowi: #agreed
Getkey: The story would be
Getkey: I am the hero
Getkey: Oh, a chest
Getkey: What is that
Getkey: A suit
Getkey: TADADAM
* Getkey wears suit
Flowi: :O
* Getkey jumps
Flowi: :OOO
Getkey: #OMG
Flowi: #epic
```
Another suggestion was "DontLookAtIt" - DLAI (pronounced Delay), but we thought this might be not the proper name to publish it.

## How to run
```sh
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```
Now you can access it at `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
